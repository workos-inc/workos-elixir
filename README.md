# workos-elixir

WorkOS official Elixir package for interacting with WorkOS APIs

## Documentation

Complete documentation for the latest version of WorkOS Ruby Gem can be found [here](https://workos-inc.github.io/workos-ruby/).

## Installation
Add this package to the list of dependencies in your `mix.exs` file:
```
def deps do
  [{:workos, "~> 0.1.2"}]
end
```
The hex package can be found here: https://hex.pm/packages/workos

## Configuration
The WorkOS API relies on two configuration parameters, the `client_id` and the `api_key`. There are two ways to configure these values with this package.

### Recommended Method
In your `config/config.exs` file you can set the `:client_id` and `:api_key` scoped to `:workos` to be used globally by default across the SDK:
```
config :workos, 
  client_id: "project_12345"
  api_key: "sk_12345",
```

Ideally, you should use environment variables to store protected keys like your `:api_key` like so:
```
config :workos, 
  client_id: System.get_env("WORKOS_CLIENT_ID"),
  api_key: System.get_env("WORKOS_API_KEY")
```

### Opts Method
Alternatively, you can override or avoid using these globally configured variables by passing a `:api_key` or `:client_id` directly to SDK methods via the optional `opts` parameter available on all methods:
```
WorkOS.SSO.get_authorization_url(%{
  domain: "workos.com",
  redirect_uri: "https://workos.com"
}, [
  client_id: "project_12345",
  api_key: "sk_12345"
])
```
This is great if you need to switch client IDs on the fly.
